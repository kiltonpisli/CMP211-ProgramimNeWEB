                <p>The largest city and Albania’s capital, Tirana, is a must-add to your Albania travel list. Although
                    Tirana was established in 1614, it was inhabited long before that in the Bronze Ages and once
                    occupied by the Roman and Byzantine Empires.
                    The city’s now colorful facades have almost removed the memories of its Communist past, and the many
                    cafes serving Kafe Turks and trilece enamor the visitor with delicious Albanian food. From history
                    to food to art, Tirana has a lot to offer her visitors.
                    But you already knew that, didn’t you? That’s why you’re here looking for the best hotels in Tirana
                    to stay in. And we’ve got the very best Albania accommodation here for you as well.</p>
